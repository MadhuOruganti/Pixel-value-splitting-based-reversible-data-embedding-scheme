Reversible data hiding/embedding (RDH) is a well known technique in the field of image information security system. A novel RDH scheme is proposed in this article using place values of the grayscale image pixel’s intensity level. All pixels of the image is split into two halves based on their place values i.e., 100’s & 10’s combined and is referred as group-A set and remaining 1’s place value kept into group-B set. Based on the methodology we propose a Pixel Value Splitting based RDH scheme and may be abbreviated as PVS-RDH scheme. Smooth regions of the image generally have similar group-A values and is the desired region for PVS-RDH scheme. In the proposed scheme, data hiding is performed in the adjacent pairs whose group-A values are same. Further, to increase visual fidelity of the embedded image with respect to original image, corresponding group-B values are also modified by using positive or negative offsets accordingly to reduce the difference created by modification in corresponding group-A sets. Experimental results and performance metrics are analyzed with recent state of art methods which proven that the proposed scheme performs better.
